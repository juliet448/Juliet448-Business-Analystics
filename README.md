### INTRODUCTION TO THE CAPSTONE PROJECT ON HUMAN RESOURCES Data Analysis
---
This Capstone Project undertakes a comprehensive data analysis initiative focused on Human Resources, with the objective of extracting meaningful insights from HR datasets and informing strategic decision-making.

Throughout this project, a range of HR datasets will be analyzed, incorporating data cleaning, manipulation, and analytical techniques to identify trends and patterns in employee demographics, turnover, performance, and other key HR metrics.

Utilizing Excel, initial data exploration and analysis will be conducted, employing functions and matrix tables to summarize key HR findings, such as:

- Employee turnover and retention rates
- Diversity and inclusion metrics
- Employee satisfaction and engagement levels

To present findings in a dynamic and user-friendly format, Power BI will be employed to create interactive visualizations and dashboards. This will facilitate stakeholder engagement with the data, promoting a deeper understanding of the insights derived from the analysis.

Ultimately, this Capstone Project aims to demonstrate the application of data analysis techniques in Human Resources, enhancing our ability to inform strategic decision-making and drive business outcomes through data-driven insights.
